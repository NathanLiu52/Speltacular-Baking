                My name is River Lawrence, I'm wheat-intolerant and I'm passionate about baking. Thanks to spelt
                flour, I can have my cake and eat it too!

            <p>
                What is spelt, you ask?
            </p>

                Also known as triticum spelta, spelt is a tasty whole grain with a nutty flavour. This
                distant cousin of wheat contains gluten and is therefore not suitable for those who have
                gluten intolerance, though it does tend to be easier to digest than wheat and may be
                better tolerated by those who have wheat sensitivity.
